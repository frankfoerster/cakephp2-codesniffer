CakePHP Code Sniffer
====================

This code works with [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
and checks code against the coding standards used in CakePHP.

Based on  cakephp/cakephp-codesniffer 0.1.23

These standards have been adjusted for use in custom CakePHP applications:

  - docblock comments should not start at the beginning of a line, but at the function level
  - type casts should be followed by a space (instead of no space)
